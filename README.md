# Sticky Notes App

## Architecture Overview

The app uses React and TypeScript with separate components for each UI element: `<Header>` handles toolbar actions; `<Main>` holds the notes; `<Note>` manages a single note and its subcomponents `<NoteHeader>`, `<NoteContent>`, and `<NoteMenu>` for title editing, text input, and controls. State is stored in a Zustand store (`useNotesStore`) that tracks note details, layering (z-index), and drag/resize status. Notes are saved and restored from localStorage using Zustandâ€™s `persist` middleware.

Pointer events manage dragging and resizing, and `requestAnimationFrame` updates note positions smoothly. A simple collision check with the trash zone handles deletion, and bringing a note to the front happens on pointer down. The `useLocalStorage` hook saves theme settings, and `ThemeContext` toggles between light and dark modes.
